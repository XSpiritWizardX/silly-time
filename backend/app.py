Add a GameState model with fields like coins (int >= 0), distance (float >= 0), upgrades (dict[str,int]), and timestamps. Implement GET /game/{player_id} to return storage.get or a default GameState. Implement PUT /game/{player_id} to validate input and upsert via storage.set. Implement POST /game/{player_id}/upgrade to accept {"upgrade_id": "speed"}, load state, call upgrade_rules.apply_upgrade, persist the updated state, and return it. Return 400 with clear messages for unknown upgrades, insufficient coins, or maxed upgrades.
