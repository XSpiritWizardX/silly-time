Implement an upgrade registry for at least speed, jump, and coin_magnet upgrades with base_cost, growth_rate, and max_level. Add domain errors: UnknownUpgradeError, InsufficientCoinsError, MaxUpgradeLevelError. Expose apply_upgrade(state, upgrade_id) that validates state, computes current-level cost, deducts coins, increments level, and returns updated state. Add helper get_upgrade_view(state) for UI/API responses (current level, next cost, maxed).
